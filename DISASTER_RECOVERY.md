# üö® Disaster Recovery & Prevention Guide

## What Went Wrong (Sept 12, 2025)
- **Root Cause**: `git reset --hard origin/master` on server wiped all local development
- **Lost**: Auto-sync system, custom controllers, addons, advanced features
- **Recovery**: Used `git reflog` to restore from local repository
- **Duration**: ~2 hours of panic + 1 hour recovery

## üõ°Ô∏è Prevention Measures

### 1. **Automated Pre-Deployment Backups**
Before ANY server operation that could lose data:

```bash
# Always run this BEFORE git operations on server
ssh thilacoloma "cd /var/www && tar -czf backup_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)_pre-operation.tar.gz thilacoloma/"
```

### 2. **Safe Deployment Protocol**
NEVER use `git reset --hard` again. Instead:

```bash
# Safe deployment steps:
1. ssh thilacoloma "cd /var/www/thilacoloma && git stash push -m 'Pre-deployment stash $(date)'"
2. ssh thilacoloma "cd /var/www/thilacoloma && git fetch origin"
3. ssh thilacoloma "cd /var/www/thilacoloma && git merge origin/master"
4. # If conflicts: resolve manually, don't use --hard reset
5. ssh thilacoloma "cd /var/www/thilacoloma && git stash pop" # if needed
```

### 3. **Work-in-Progress Protection**
- **Branch Strategy**: Keep development work in feature branches
- **Regular Commits**: Commit work every hour minimum
- **Push Frequently**: Push branches to GitHub as backup

### 4. **Server State Monitoring**
- **Daily Backups**: Automated daily server backups
- **Git Status Checks**: Monitor for uncommitted changes before operations
- **Recovery Testing**: Monthly disaster recovery drills

### 5. **Emergency Recovery Tools**

#### Quick Server Backup
```bash
./emergency-backup.sh
```

#### Safe Server Update
```bash
./safe-deploy.sh
```

#### Recovery from Local
```bash
./recover-from-local.sh
```

### 6. **Early Warning System**
- **Pre-commit hooks**: Check server sync status
- **Deployment warnings**: Confirm destructive operations
- **Automatic backups**: Before any git reset/checkout

## üöÄ Emergency Contacts & Procedures

### If Disaster Strikes Again:
1. **DON'T PANIC** - Your work is likely still recoverable
2. **Check git reflog first**: `git reflog --all`
3. **Look for local backups**: Check backup directories
4. **Contact support**: Document what commands were run

### Recovery Commands:
```bash
# Find lost work
git reflog --oneline | head -20

# Recover specific commit
git checkout -b recovery-branch COMMIT_HASH

# Merge back
git checkout master
git merge recovery-branch
```

## üìä Success Metrics
- **Zero Data Loss**: No work lost to deployment issues
- **Fast Recovery**: < 15 minutes to recover from issues
- **Automated Safety**: All backups and checks automated
- **Team Confidence**: No fear of deployment

**Remember**: It's better to be safe than sorry. Always backup before risky operations!
